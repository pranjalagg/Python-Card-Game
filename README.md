# Python-Card-Game
This a card game based on python's module 'tkinter'. It is a single player game where a player can fight with computer's knights(as in cards) using their own knights. Their are four arenas where knights will fight to win. Each arena build is based on a natural scenario. Four different scenario favours each one of the knights. Each knight has their own skill and armour. After every single fight their power of armour and health tends to decrease as per the fight. Each fight either a point to computer or the player. But, if the battle fought ends up in a tie then no one gets the point. In the end, the one with four points will win the game. It could also end up being a tie.
